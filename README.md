# CounterTextView
This is a POC of a 'perfectly' centered text in android....(where 'gravity' is not enough).
Part of this code is based on a Chris Banes's blog post (https://chris.banes.me/2014/03/27/measuring-text/).

I think a couple of bits in the original Chris post are not correct (at least in my case) so I decided to build a prototype.
