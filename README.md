# CounterTextView
This is a POC of a 'perfectly' centered text in android....(where 'gravity' is not enough).
Part of this code is based on a Chris Banes's blog post (https://chris.banes.me/2014/03/27/measuring-text/).

The traditional way of centering text and rounded it's layout can be achieved playing with gravity and rounded shape as backgound. If this approach works for you, cool! just use it ;)

If on the other end you want a self-centering text wiew, with a convenient self-roundering layer, feel free to have a look here.

PS: I think that some  bits in the original Chris' post are not correct (at least in my case) so I decided to build this prototype with small tweaks and fixes.
